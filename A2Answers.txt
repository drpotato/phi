    Flat filesystems are excellent for drives with a small amount of storage capability as there is little overhead storing metadata about hierarchy.

3.
    It becomes difficult to find files in a flat filesystem if the number of files stored becomes too large.

4.
    Use of a b-tree can increase the speed of searching through the file names to log(n) runtime, however this comes at
    the cost of storing the filesystem in memory.
